If she had 17 bags, but didn't recycle 8 of them, how many points would she have earned?\nA: Let's think step by step. \n\nFirst, we need to calculate how many points Bianca would have earned if she had recycled all 17 bags. We can do this by multiplying 5 points by 17 bags. So, 5 times 17 equals 85. \n\nNext, we need to calculate how many points Bianca would have LOST if she did not recycle 8 bags. We can do this by multiplying 5 points by 8 bags. So, 5 times 8 equals 40. \n\nFinally, we need to subtract the 40 points that Bianca lost from the 85 points that she earned. So, 85 minus 40 equals 45. \n\nTherefore, Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is",
