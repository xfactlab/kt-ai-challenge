How much farther did Wendy run than walk?\nA: Let's think step by step. \nFirst, we need to convert everything to the same units. In this case, we can convert everything to miles. \n19.833333333333332 miles = 19.833333333333332 * 1 miles = 19.833333333333332 miles\n9.166666666666666 miles = 9.166666666666666 * 1 miles = 9.166666666666666 miles\nNow that we have the same units, we can compare how much farther Wendy ran than walked. \n19.833333333333332 miles - 9.166666666666666 miles = 10.666666666666664 miles\n\nTherefore, the answer is",

This is the same as 1/6 of a ton, or 0.167 tons. \nThe company ordered 0.5 of a ton of stone. This is the same as 1/2 of a ton, or 0.5 tons. \n\nAdding these all up, we get that the company ordered 1.167 tons of material in all.\nTherefore, the answer is",
